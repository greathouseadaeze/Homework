# Adaeze Greathouse

#### My name is Adaeze Greathouse and I am learning to code. I am an aspiring Full Stack Web Developer enrolled in a bootcamp with Savvy Coders. My interest in tech and coding began with my last job at Square Inc. where I was introduced to the concept of building websites working as a customer success advocate on the Weebly and Square Online team, assisting website owners with the management and creation of their sites. I look forward to learning as much as I can in this tech space and going as far as my mind and curiosity will take me.

#### Goals for this course:

* Learn Javascript
* Get a job in tech
* Gain a solid understanding of code fundamentals
* Master all my assignments and graduate on time
